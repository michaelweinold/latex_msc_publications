\section{Manufacturing Cost Model}

\subsection{Structure of the Model}

\end{figure}

The cost model adapted for this publication is a microeconomic manufacturing cost model. Within the timeframe and scope laid out in the main publication, it returns the total manufacturing cost of phosphor converted warm white light-emitting diode packages. In this computation, it considers the main economic factors associated with operating and maintaining manufacturing equipment. It does not consider costs associated with research and development or those associated with the construction of manufacturing facilities. It considers market trends through their effect on manufacturing parameters.

A schematic diagram of the cost model developed in this thesis is presented in figure \ref{fig:costmodel-schematic}. The cost model is process step based. It is split between the upstream part of the manufacturing process and the downstream part of the manufacturing process. The former is performed at the wafer level. The latter is performed at the package level. The model takes as inputs both parameters specific to manufacturing process steps (\textit{"step parameters"}) and parameters applying to all manufacturing steps (\textit{"global steps"}). The cost for each process step is then computed. The cost model returns the total and step manufacturing costs. It further considers the yield per step and returns the cumulative yield, the yielded cost per step and the yielded total manufacturing cost.

\subsection{Examples of Chip Architectures}

Figures \ref{fig:manuf_vtf_2012-1}-\ref{fig:manuf_csp_2020-2} show a simplified rendering of the manufacturing process of two differente chip architectures considered in the cost model.

\subsection{Computation of Manufacturing Cost}

The manufacturing process of semiconductor devices can be categorized by the level of integration at which steps are implemented. While the upstream steps in the manufacturing flow are carried out at the wafer level, the packaging steps are typically carried out at the die/package level. The total manufacturing cost per die is thus the sum of the total costs of all wafer processing steps and all die packaging steps.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cost_sum}
    C \bigg[ \frac{ \$(2020) }{ \text{die} } \bigg] = P_S + C_w + C_p
\end{equation}

where

\begin{align*}
    P_S &\dots \text{sapphire substrate price} \\
    C_w &\dots \text{wafer processing cost} \\
    C_p &\dots \text{die processing cost}
\end{align*}

The total wafer processing cost and total die packaging costs are in turn the sum of all associated process steps.

\begin{align}
	C_w &= \sum_i C_i \\
	C_p &= \sum_j C_j
\end{align}

The cost of a single process step $C_i$ can now be written as

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cost_wafer}
    C_i \bigg[ \frac{ \$(2020) }{ \text{die} } \bigg] =\frac{1}{D}  \frac{1}{y_i}   \bigg\{ \bigg((e*p) + l + m + d +o \bigg)_i \bigg( \frac{t_i}{w_i u_i} \bigg) + \sum_{x} v_x p_x \bigg\}
\end{equation}

where the index $i$ runs over all wafer processing steps, the index $j$ runs over all die processing steps and the indices $x,y$ run over all materials.

\begin{align*}
        D &\dots \text{good die per wafer} \label{def:cost_wafer_first} \\
        y &\dots \text{process step yield} \\
        u &\dots \text{equipment utilization} \\
        p &\dots \text{power consumption} \\
        e &\dots \text{hourly electricity cost} \\
        m &\dots \text{hourly maintenance cost} \\
        d &\dots \text{hourly depreciation cost}\\
        l &\dots \text{hourly labour cost} \\
        o &\dots \text{hourly overhead cost} \\
        t_i &\dots \text{time per run} \\
        w &\dots \text{wafers per run} \\
        A &\dots \text{wafer area} \\
        v_x &\dots \text{volume of substance per wafer} \\
        p_x &\dots \text{price of substance $x$ per volume}\\
\end{align*}

The number of die per wafer $D$ depends on the total USAble wafer area. The USAble area depends on the wafer diameter, the cutting street width between the chips and the exclusion zone at the rim of the wafer.

\begin{equation}
	A_{\text{USAble}}=A_{\text{wafer}}-A_{\text{cut}}-A_{\text{exclusion}}
\end{equation}

Determining the USAble wafer area as a of these three parameters requires a numerical solution. However, following discussions in literature \cite{de2005investigation}, we approximate the number of good die per wafer as

\begin{equation}
label{eqn:dpw}
	D=\frac{\pi}{4}  \bigg ( \frac{d-2e}{\sqrt{a}+s/2} \bigg ) ^2 - \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{d-2e}{(\sqrt{a}+s/2)^2}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{align*}
    d &\dots \text{wafer diameter} \\
    e &\dots \text{wafer edge exclusion zone width} \\
    a &\dots \text{die area} \\
    s &\dots \text{cutting street width} \\
\end{align*}

which gives us for the cost of a manufacturing step $C_i$ in the wafer processing category

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cost_wafer_full}
\begin{split}
    C_i \bigg[ \frac{ \$(2020) }{ \text{die} } \bigg] &= \bigg (  \frac{\pi}{4}  \bigg ( \frac{d-2e}{\sqrt{a}+s/2} \bigg ) ^2 - \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{d-2e}{(\sqrt{a}+s/2)^2} \bigg )^{-1} \times \\
    &  \frac{1}{y_i}  \bigg\{ \bigg((e*p) + l + m + d +o \bigg)_i \bigg( \frac{t_i}{w_i u_i} \bigg) + \sum_{x} v_x p_x \bigg\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

and the cost of a manufacturing step $C_j$ in the packaging category

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cost_die}
    C_j \bigg[ \frac{ \$(2020) }{ \text{die} } \bigg] = \frac{1}{y_j}  \bigg\{ \bigg((e*p) + l + m + d + o \bigg)_i  \frac{c_j}{u_j} + \sum_{x} a v_x p_x \bigg\}
\end{equation}

where $c_j$ is $\text{throughput}^{-1}$. The total cost is thus
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cost_total}
\begin{split}
    C= P_s &+ \sum_i \bigg \{ \frac{1}{D} \frac{1}{y_i} \bigg[ \frac{t_i}{w_i u_i} \bigg((e*p) + l + m + d +o \bigg)_i  + \sum_{x} v_x p_x \bigg] \bigg \} + \\
    & + \sum_j \bigg \{ \frac{1}{y_j} \bigg[ \frac{c_j}{u_j}  \bigg((e*p) + l + m + d + o \bigg)_i + \sum_{x} a v_x p_x \bigg ] \bigg\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Note that in keeping with the categorization introduced by the United States Department of energy, certain steps from these two categories are reported separately. In the wafer processing category, the epitaxy step is reported separately due to its complexity and the large share of cost carried. In the wafer processing category, the phosphor step is reported separately.

\subsection{Computation of Yielded Cost}

Devices may be damaged or otherwise rendered unUSAble during the manufacturing process. The ratio between the number of good devices per step and the number of handled devices per step is known as the yield. Optimizing this yield is critical for reducing manufacturing cost \cite{Kumar2006}. This is because cumulative yield quickly drops as the yield from manufacturing steps with below 100\% yield is multiplied. We must thus consider not only the manufacturing cost per process step, but also the cost including the yield \cite{becker2001use}\cite{becker2001using}. While there are different mathematical approaches to including yield, we follow the definition in  \cite{becker2001use}. We write for the yielded cost $C_{Y_i}$ of a step $i$

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\label{eqn:C_2}
    C_{Y_1} &= \frac{C_1}{Y_1} \\
    C_{Y_2} &= \frac{C_1 + C_2}{Y_1 Y_2} - C_{Y_1} = \frac{C_1 + C_2}{Y_1 Y_2} - \frac{C_1}{Y_1} = \frac{1}{Y_1 Y_2} \bigg ( C_1 (1-Y_2) +C_2 \bigg)\\
    C_{Y_i} &= \frac{ \sum_{x \leq i} C_x }{ \prod_{x \leq i} Y_x } - \frac{ \sum_{x<i} C_x }{ \prod_{x<i} Y_x }
\end{split}
\end{equation}

If a step is applied more than once, we can conveniently rewrite this in a form suited to computation within the \textit{Excel} worksheet. Assuming step $2$ is used twice, we get for the yielded cost of this step an equation of the form

\begin{align}
\label{eqn:C_2^2}
    C_{Y_2}^{(2 \times)} &= \bigg( \frac{C_1 + C_2}{Y_1 Y_2} - \frac{C_1}{Y_1} \bigg) + \bigg( \frac{C_1 + 2 C_2}{Y_1 Y_2^2} - \frac{C_1 + C_2}{Y_1 Y_2}     \bigg) \\
    &= \frac{1}{Y_1 Y_2^2} \bigg( C_1 (1-Y_2^2) +2C_2 \bigg)
\end{align}

which can be compared to equation \ref{eqn:C_2} for a more general form.

\begin{equation}
    C_2^{(n \times)} = \frac{1}{Y_1 Y_2^n} \bigg( C_1 (1-Y_2^n)+nC_2\bigg)
\end{equation}

Omitting a proof by induction, we get for the general term for a step $i>1$ repeated $n$ times an equation of the form

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:yielded_cost}
    C_{Y_{i>1}}^{(n \times)} = \frac{1}{Y_i^{n-1} \prod_{x \leq i} Y_x} \bigg( nC_i + \sum_{x < i} C_x (1-Y_i^n) \bigg)
\end{equation}

This cummulative approach to yielded cost is different from the approach taken in the original \textit{LEDCOM} model. It uses what in literature is described as an \textit{"itemized approach"} to yielded cost \cite{becker2001use}. The yielded cost of a single process step $f$ is described by

\begin{equation}
	f_\text{single} = \frac{i+s}{y}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{align*}
    i &\dots \text{material cost of previous step} \\
    s &\dots \text{step cost}
\end{align*}

For process steps that are performed more than once, a series expression is used

\begin{align}
\label{eqn:series}
    f_{\times 2} &=  \frac{\frac{i+s}{y}+s}{y} \\
    f_{\times n} &= \frac{i + s(1+y+y^2+ \dots + y^{n-1})}{y^n}
\end{align}

This itemized approach serves as a convenient approximation, but its cumulative contributions do not equal the total yielded cost of the entire manufacturing process

\begin{equation}
    f_\text{total} = \frac{\sum_i^n s_i}{\prod_i^ny_i} \neq \sum_i^n f_i
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the total number of steps. This is due to the approximation introduced through the series approximation in equation \ref{eqn:series}.

\subsection{Computation of the Contribution of Variables}

To quantify the drivers of cost reductions across all process steps, one would need to identify the magnitude of contribution to cost reductions made by single variables in equations \ref{eqn:cost_wafer} and \ref{eqn:cost_die}. Mathematically, given a function $C$ which describes the cost associated with manufacturing a single unit at time $t$,

\begin{equation}
C=ab+cd
\end{equation}

and manufacturing variables $a,b,c,d$, we are looking for the contribution $\Delta C_{a}$ made by a single variable $a$ to the total change in the cost function $\Delta C$ between points $t_0,t_1$ such, that

\begin{equation}
\Delta C = C(t_1)-C(t_0) = \sum_{i=a, \dots, d} \Delta C_i
\end{equation}

The infinitesimal contribution to the total cost by the infinitesimal change in a cost model variable is defined through the total differential of the cost function \ref{eqn:cost_sum} as

\begin{equation}
\text{d}C(x_1 (t), x_2(t), \dots) = \sum_i \frac{\partial C }{\partial x_i}     \frac{\text{d}x_i}{\text{d}t} = \sum_i \frac{\partial C }{\partial x_i}  \Delta x_i
\end{equation}

where $x_i$ is an arbitrary cost variable. The contribution of the change $\Delta x_1$ in variable $x_1$ to total cost $C$ over the period $t_0 < t < t_1 $ is then

\begin{equation}
\Delta C_{x_1} = \int_{t=t_1}^{t_2} \frac{\partial C }{\partial x_1} \frac{\text{d}x_1}{\text{d}t} \text{d}t
\label{eqn:integral_1}
\end{equation}

However, data on the cost model variables is not available in continuous time. Disaggregating the contribution of single variables to the total cost reduction is thus not straightforward in our model. This problem does not arise in cost models which compute cost changes directly, such as \cite{nemet2012solar} \cite{goodrich2013assessing}. The following discussion follows an approach developed by Kavlak et al. \cite{kavlak2018evaluating}. For the detailed derivation, we refer to this publication.

The cost function $C$ as a function of a vector of cost model variables $\vec{r}=(r_1,r_2,\dots)$ is defined as

\begin{equation}
C(\vec{r}) = C(r_1,r_2, \dots) = \sum_i C_i
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
C_i(\vec{r}) = C_i^0 \prod_w g_{iw}(r_w)
\end{equation}

Using logarithmic differentiation, the integral from equation \ref{eqn:integral_1} can be rewritten as

\begin{equation}
\Delta C_x = \int_{t=t_0}^{t_1} C(t) \frac{ \partial \ln C }{ \partial x } \frac{ \text{d} x }{ \text{d} t} \text{d} t
\end{equation}

where for $C(t)$ a constant $C(t) \approx \tilde{C} $ can be chosen such that $\Delta C_{x_i} = \Delta C$. In practice, this constant value can be approximated as $\tilde{C} \approx \frac{2}{3} C_i^\text{geo} + \frac{1}{3} \overline{C_i}$. The contribution of a single cost model variable $r_z$ can then be written as

\begin{equation}
\Delta C_z (t_1,t_2) \approx \sum_i \tilde{C_i} \ln \frac{g_{iz}(t_2)}{g_{iz}(t_1)}
\end{equation}

This approach was used to determine the effect of spillovers on device performance, displayed in figure \ref{fig:breakthroughs_efficiency}. Due to time constraints, this approach could not be used to determine the effect of spillovers on manufacturing cost. Future work to quantify the impact of different cost drivers, including breakthroughs and changes in the manufacturing variables of equation \ref{eqn:cost_sum}, could this method.

\subsection{Preliminary Sensitivity Analysis}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{2_SSL_EES/article/figures/costmodel_sensitivity.pdf}
	\caption{Panels a-b: Sensitivity analysis of selected cost model parameters. Note the decreasing sensitivity to cost model parameters as the number of die per wafer increases.}
	\label{fig:sensitivity}
\end{figure}

A sensitivity analysis of the cost model has been performed using parameter variations listed in table \ref{tab:sensitivity}. The amount of parameter variation was chosen to encompass the identified range of the value of the parameter in different manufacturing setups of each considered year. As an example, the lower range in the variation for metal cost (+50\%,-0\%) was chosen because the metal prices in the model are price quotes from the United State Geological Survey price database. Industry metals are not sold below the price of the raw material and often the markup is small compared to the price of the material. The upper range was chosen, because a survey of industrial metal suppliers for semiconductor manufacturing showed that the largest markup was below 50\%. The results of the analysis are shown in figure \ref{fig:sensitivity}. The cost model is generally more sensitive to variation of parameters at smaller wafer diameters. The most sensitive parameters are global parameters, such as yield or average equipment throughput.

\subsection{Comparison with Reported Industry Data}

We note differences between our model and costs reported to the US Department of Energy (DoE) by industry. For instance, the share of the epitaxy step is larger in the DoE model. This can in part be explained by our model relying on state-of-the-art equipment, while industry might not run low-power and mid-power chip production on these, more expensive, reactors. The packaging part of the manufacturing process is increasing in importance, which has been confirmed by researchers and industry reports on wafer-level packaging.

\subsection{History of Identifies Phosphor Inventions}

\subsubsection{YAG and YGAG Phosphors}

Prior to Nakamura’s invention of highly efficient blue LEDs in the 1990s, Japan’s Nichia Corporation had not sold commercially successful semiconductor products, instead specializing in phosphors for cathode ray tubes (CRT) and fluorescent lamps \cite{nakamura2013blue}  . Nevertheless, extensive firm expertise in this area helped Nichia’s Yoshinori Shimizu formulate the principles of using CRT phosphors to convert blue light from Nakamura’s LEDs into white light in 1994 \cite{shimizu1994sheet},\cite{cho2017white}. By 1996, Shimizu and his colleagues developed \cite{bando1996}, \cite{shimizu1999light} the first practical LED application of a well-known Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (YAG) CRT phosphor activated with cerium \cite{blasse1967new}, enabling the first commercial white LED products manufactured and sold by Nichia since late 1996 \cite{bando1998development}, \cite{cho2017white}. 

Importantly, the YAG phosphor does not exhibit the spectral properties desirable in general illumination applications (see Figure 8 in the main text). An early solution to this problem, which was first discovered in the late 1967 \cite{holloway1969optical} and suggested for LEDs by the same team at Nichia in 1996 \cite{bando1998development},\cite{shimizu1999light}, was to use the gadolinium-doped red-shifted YAG phosphor (YGAG). Used in combination with red-emitting sulfide phosphors, by 2002 it helped bring to the market the first generation of warm white light LED products, e.g., those produced by Lumileds \cite{Mueller2002}. However, sulfide phosphors led to accelerated deterioration of sensitive parts of LED devices and became less efficient as operating temperatures increased. New chemically stable and non-toxic red phosphors were needed. 

\subsubsection{258, SLA and SALON phosphors}

In 1997, Hubert Huppertz and Wolfgang Schnick, working at the University of Bayreuth in Germany, synthesized the first compound in a new class of rare earth nitridosilicate materials \cite{Huppertz1997} later dubbed “258” due to a proportion of elements in its chemical formula. The luminescent properties of these materials were identified by the Schnick’s group, by then at Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, in 2000 \cite{Hppe2000} after a suggestion made to Schnick at a conference following earlier reports of good luminosity properties of europium-doped compounds \cite{Qiua1998}. U.S.-based LED manufacturer Lumileds applied for a patent for the first class of red LED phosphors based on the 258 nitridosilicate chemistry in 2002 \cite{mueller2004phosphor}. The first use of the 258 phosphor in a commercial “Luxeon” LED package was then reported in a joint publication co-authored by inventors from Lumileds and researchers from the Schnick’s group in 2005 \cite{MuellerMach2005}.

Further efforts in LED phosphor development were directed towards synthesizing a red narrow-band phosphor. Narrow LED emission peak widths yield the highest luminous efficacy of radiation, as in this case less light is emitted in the far-red range of the spectrum in which the human eye is not very sensitive. After synthesizing several narrow-band phosphors emitting in yellow \cite{Hppe2004} and cyan \cite{Kechele2009}, the Schnick’s group identified the local cubic cation coordination structure of the cyan phosphor compound as the reason for its narrow band width \cite{lumi2016narrow}. A search for a structurally analogous nitride compound with the narrow red instead of the cyan emission was undertaken. After several unsuccessful attempts, the sought-after cuboidal nitride compound was found in a 2008 publication led by Francis DiSalvo \cite{Park2008Sr}. Based on information provided in this work, Schnick and colleagues synthesized and studied the spectral properties of a new narrow band red SLA phosphor in 2013 \cite{schmidt2013new}\cite{Pust2014}\cite{schmidt2017phosphors}. The material was introduced in commercial LED devices by Lumileds in 2015 \cite{lumi2016narrow_whitepaper}. 

The most recent red narrow-band phosphor breakthrough included in Table 3 and Figure 8 in the main text, indicated as SALON, has been under development during the late 2010s by a group of Austrian and German researchers that included Huppertz, the discoverer of the “258” material, working in collaboration with Osram, another major LED manufacturer \cite{seibald2019phosphor}, \cite{Hoerder2019} , \cite{Hoerder2020}. The first patent application for this phosphor was filed in 2016. The SALON phosphor is a derivate of the SLA phosphor. Therefore, it is the only innovation related to consumer experience metrics identified in our study that seemingly not involved technology spillovers.
