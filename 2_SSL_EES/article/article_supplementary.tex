\section{Lighting Metrics}

\subsection{Luminous Efficacy (of Radiation)}
\label{subsec:ler}

Efficacy in lighting is dependent on the luminosity function, which describes the wavelength-dependent sensitivity of the human eye. A light source emitting very \textit{efficiently} in the infrared yet emitting no visible light has a very low \textit{efficacy}. The luminous efficacy of radiation $K$ is mathematically defined as the normalized, integrated product of the spectral radiant flux of a light source with the wavelength dependent human sensitivity to light \cite{cie-term-effrad}

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ler}
    K [\text{lm/W}_{opt}]= \frac{\int_0^\infty K( \lambda ) \phi \text{d} \lambda}{\int_0^\infty \phi \text{d} \lambda}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{align*}
    K &\dots \text{spectral luminous efficacy} \\
    \phi &\dots \text{spectral radiant flux} \\
    \lambda &\dots \text{wavelength}
\end{align*}

This metric can be computed from spectral data alone and does not require additional spectral normalization. It enables straightforward comparison between the performance of different downconversion phosphors, as shown in figure \ref{fig:se_efficacy} in chapter \ref{ch:results}. Light sources emitting in the far red or blue part of the spectrum have lower efficacy of radiation, as the product with the luminosity function of figure \ref{fig:tristimulus} shows. Care must be taken not to confuse this efficacy metric with efficacy of source, which depends not only on the spectral power distribution of a light source.

This metric describes the match of a light-emitting diode package spectrum to the human visual system. It thus describes only a part of the total device performance. 

\subsection{Luminous Efficacy (of Source)}
\label{subsec:les}

In contrast to the efficacy \textit{of radiation} $K$, the luminous efficacy \textit{of a light source} $\eta$ is defined as the ratio between the emitted luminous flux and the consumed electrical power \cite{cie-term-effsrc}

\begin{equation}
    \eta [\text{lm/W}_{el}]= \frac{\phi}{P_{el}}
\end{equation}

Unlike the luminous efficacy of radiation, this metric cannot be extracted from the spectrum of a light source. It is often cited in device datasheets, scientific literature and textbooks when describing the performance of light-emitting diodes. Care must be taken not to confuse this efficacy metric with efficacy of radiation, which depends only on the spectral power distribution of a light source. As it captures overall device efficacy, it depends on a large number of device properties and parameters. This makes attribution to single changes in device design or manufacturing difficult.

\subsection{Arbitrary Units}
\label{subsec:arbunit}

In spectroscopy, an arbitrary unit (abbreviated "Arb. Unit") is a relative unit of measurement to show the ratio of the intensity to a predetermined reference. In the case of Figure \ref{fig:phosphor_spectrum}, the reference is the highest point in the spectrum.

\section{Manufacturing Cost Model}
\label{sec:costmodel}

\subsection{Structure of the Model}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \tikzfig{./figures/costmodel}
    \centering
    \caption{Schematic diagram of the cost model showing inputs to each step and computational steps leading to cost model outputs. For description of cost variables, see definitions for equation \ref{eqn:cost_wafer}.}
    \label{fig:costmodel-schematic}
    \vspace{-8pt}
\end{figure}

The cost model adapted for this publication is a microeconomic manufacturing cost model. Within the timeframe and scope laid out in the main publication, it returns the total manufacturing cost of phosphor converted warm white light-emitting diode packages. In this computation, it considers the main economic factors associated with operating and maintaining manufacturing equipment. It does not consider costs associated with research and development or those associated with the construction of manufacturing facilities. It considers market trends through their effect on manufacturing parameters.

A schematic diagram of the cost model developed in this thesis is presented in figure \ref{fig:costmodel-schematic}. The cost model is process step based. It is split between the upstream part of the manufacturing process and the downstream part of the manufacturing process. The former is performed at the wafer level. The latter is performed at the package level. The model takes as inputs both parameters specific to manufacturing process steps (\textit{"step parameters"}) and parameters applying to all manufacturing steps (\textit{"global steps"}). The cost for each process step is then computed. The cost model returns the total and step manufacturing costs. It further considers the yield per step and returns the cumulative yield, the yielded cost per step and the yielded total manufacturing cost.

\subsection{Examples of Chip Architectures}

Figures \ref{fig:manuf_vtf_2012-1}-\ref{fig:manuf_csp_2020-2} show a simplified rendering of the manufacturing process of two differente chip architectures considered in the cost model.

\subsection{Computation of Manufacturing Cost}

The manufacturing process of semiconductor devices can be categorized by the level of integration at which steps are implemented. While the upstream steps in the manufacturing flow are carried out at the wafer level, the packaging steps are typically carried out at the die/package level. The total manufacturing cost per die is thus the sum of the total costs of all wafer processing steps and all die packaging steps.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cost_sum}
    C \bigg[ \frac{ \$(2020) }{ \text{die} } \bigg] = P_S + C_w + C_p
\end{equation}

where

\begin{align*}
    P_S &\dots \text{sapphire substrate price} \\
    C_w &\dots \text{wafer processing cost} \\
    C_p &\dots \text{die processing cost}
\end{align*}

The total wafer processing cost and total die packaging costs are in turn the sum of all associated process steps.

\begin{align}
	C_w &= \sum_i C_i \\
	C_p &= \sum_j C_j
\end{align}

The cost of a single process step $C_i$ can now be written as

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cost_wafer}
    C_i \bigg[ \frac{ \$(2020) }{ \text{die} } \bigg] =\frac{1}{D}  \frac{1}{y_i}   \bigg\{ \bigg((e*p) + l + m + d +o \bigg)_i \bigg( \frac{t_i}{w_i u_i} \bigg) + \sum_{x} v_x p_x \bigg\}
\end{equation}

where the index $i$ runs over all wafer processing steps, the index $j$ runs over all die processing steps and the indices $x,y$ run over all materials.

\begin{align*}
        D &\dots \text{good die per wafer} \label{def:cost_wafer_first} \\
        y &\dots \text{process step yield} \\
        u &\dots \text{equipment utilization} \\
        p &\dots \text{power consumption} \\
        e &\dots \text{hourly electricity cost} \\
        m &\dots \text{hourly maintenance cost} \\
        d &\dots \text{hourly depreciation cost}\\
        l &\dots \text{hourly labour cost} \\
        o &\dots \text{hourly overhead cost} \\
        t_i &\dots \text{time per run} \\
        w &\dots \text{wafers per run} \\
        A &\dots \text{wafer area} \\
        v_x &\dots \text{volume of substance per wafer} \\
        p_x &\dots \text{price of substance $x$ per volume}\\
\end{align*}

The number of die per wafer $D$ depends on the total USAble wafer area. The USAble area depends on the wafer diameter, the cutting street width between the chips and the exclusion zone at the rim of the wafer.

\begin{equation}
	A_{\text{USAble}}=A_{\text{wafer}}-A_{\text{cut}}-A_{\text{exclusion}}
\end{equation}

Determining the USAble wafer area as a of these three parameters requires a numerical solution. However, following discussions in literature \cite{de2005investigation}, we approximate the number of good die per wafer as

\begin{equation}
label{eqn:dpw}
	D=\frac{\pi}{4}  \bigg ( \frac{d-2e}{\sqrt{a}+s/2} \bigg ) ^2 - \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{d-2e}{(\sqrt{a}+s/2)^2}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{align*}
    d &\dots \text{wafer diameter} \\
    e &\dots \text{wafer edge exclusion zone width} \\
    a &\dots \text{die area} \\
    s &\dots \text{cutting street width} \\
\end{align*}

which gives us for the cost of a manufacturing step $C_i$ in the wafer processing category

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cost_wafer_full}
\begin{split}
    C_i \bigg[ \frac{ \$(2020) }{ \text{die} } \bigg] &= \bigg (  \frac{\pi}{4}  \bigg ( \frac{d-2e}{\sqrt{a}+s/2} \bigg ) ^2 - \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{d-2e}{(\sqrt{a}+s/2)^2} \bigg )^{-1} \times \\
    &  \frac{1}{y_i}  \bigg\{ \bigg((e*p) + l + m + d +o \bigg)_i \bigg( \frac{t_i}{w_i u_i} \bigg) + \sum_{x} v_x p_x \bigg\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

and the cost of a manufacturing step $C_j$ in the packaging category

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cost_die}
    C_j \bigg[ \frac{ \$(2020) }{ \text{die} } \bigg] = \frac{1}{y_j}  \bigg\{ \bigg((e*p) + l + m + d + o \bigg)_i  \frac{c_j}{u_j} + \sum_{x} a v_x p_x \bigg\}
\end{equation}

where $c_j$ is $\text{throughput}^{-1}$. The total cost is thus
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cost_total}
\begin{split}
    C= P_s &+ \sum_i \bigg \{ \frac{1}{D} \frac{1}{y_i} \bigg[ \frac{t_i}{w_i u_i} \bigg((e*p) + l + m + d +o \bigg)_i  + \sum_{x} v_x p_x \bigg] \bigg \} + \\
    & + \sum_j \bigg \{ \frac{1}{y_j} \bigg[ \frac{c_j}{u_j}  \bigg((e*p) + l + m + d + o \bigg)_i + \sum_{x} a v_x p_x \bigg ] \bigg\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Note that in keeping with the categorization introduced by the United States Department of energy, certain steps from these two categories are reported separately. In the wafer processing category, the epitaxy step is reported separately due to its complexity and the large share of cost carried. In the wafer processing category, the phosphor step is reported separately.

\subsection{Computation of Yielded Cost}

Devices may be damaged or otherwise rendered unUSAble during the manufacturing process. The ratio between the number of good devices per step and the number of handled devices per step is known as the yield. Optimizing this yield is critical for reducing manufacturing cost \cite{Kumar2006}. This is because cumulative yield quickly drops as the yield from manufacturing steps with below 100\% yield is multiplied. We must thus consider not only the manufacturing cost per process step, but also the cost including the yield \cite{becker2001use}\cite{becker2001using}. While there are different mathematical approaches to including yield, we follow the definition in  \cite{becker2001use}. We write for the yielded cost $C_{Y_i}$ of a step $i$

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\label{eqn:C_2}
    C_{Y_1} &= \frac{C_1}{Y_1} \\
    C_{Y_2} &= \frac{C_1 + C_2}{Y_1 Y_2} - C_{Y_1} = \frac{C_1 + C_2}{Y_1 Y_2} - \frac{C_1}{Y_1} = \frac{1}{Y_1 Y_2} \bigg ( C_1 (1-Y_2) +C_2 \bigg)\\
    C_{Y_i} &= \frac{ \sum_{x \leq i} C_x }{ \prod_{x \leq i} Y_x } - \frac{ \sum_{x<i} C_x }{ \prod_{x<i} Y_x }
\end{split}
\end{equation}

If a step is applied more than once, we can conveniently rewrite this in a form suited to computation within the \textit{Excel} worksheet. Assuming step $2$ is used twice, we get for the yielded cost of this step an equation of the form

\begin{align}
\label{eqn:C_2^2}
    C_{Y_2}^{(2 \times)} &= \bigg( \frac{C_1 + C_2}{Y_1 Y_2} - \frac{C_1}{Y_1} \bigg) + \bigg( \frac{C_1 + 2 C_2}{Y_1 Y_2^2} - \frac{C_1 + C_2}{Y_1 Y_2}     \bigg) \\
    &= \frac{1}{Y_1 Y_2^2} \bigg( C_1 (1-Y_2^2) +2C_2 \bigg)
\end{align}

which can be compared to equation \ref{eqn:C_2} for a more general form.

\begin{equation}
    C_2^{(n \times)} = \frac{1}{Y_1 Y_2^n} \bigg( C_1 (1-Y_2^n)+nC_2\bigg)
\end{equation}

Omitting a proof by induction, we get for the general term for a step $i>1$ repeated $n$ times an equation of the form

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:yielded_cost}
    C_{Y_{i>1}}^{(n \times)} = \frac{1}{Y_i^{n-1} \prod_{x \leq i} Y_x} \bigg( nC_i + \sum_{x < i} C_x (1-Y_i^n) \bigg)
\end{equation}

This cummulative approach to yielded cost is different from the approach taken in the original \textit{LEDCOM} model. It uses what in literature is described as an \textit{"itemized approach"} to yielded cost \cite{becker2001use}. The yielded cost of a single process step $f$ is described by

\begin{equation}
	f_\text{single} = \frac{i+s}{y}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{align*}
    i &\dots \text{material cost of previous step} \\
    s &\dots \text{step cost}
\end{align*}

For process steps that are performed more than once, a series expression is used

\begin{align}
\label{eqn:series}
    f_{\times 2} &=  \frac{\frac{i+s}{y}+s}{y} \\
    f_{\times n} &= \frac{i + s(1+y+y^2+ \dots + y^{n-1})}{y^n}
\end{align}

This itemized approach serves as a convenient approximation, but its cumulative contributions do not equal the total yielded cost of the entire manufacturing process

\begin{equation}
    f_\text{total} = \frac{\sum_i^n s_i}{\prod_i^ny_i} \neq \sum_i^n f_i
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the total number of steps. This is due to the approximation introduced through the series approximation in equation \ref{eqn:series}.

\subsection{Computation of the Contribution of Variables}

To quantify the drivers of cost reductions across all process steps, one would need to identify the magnitude of contribution to cost reductions made by single variables in equations \ref{eqn:cost_wafer} and \ref{eqn:cost_die}. Mathematically, given a function $C$ which describes the cost associated with manufacturing a single unit at time $t$,

\begin{equation}
C=ab+cd
\end{equation}

and manufacturing variables $a,b,c,d$, we are looking for the contribution $\Delta C_{a}$ made by a single variable $a$ to the total change in the cost function $\Delta C$ between points $t_0,t_1$ such, that

\begin{equation}
\Delta C = C(t_1)-C(t_0) = \sum_{i=a, \dots, d} \Delta C_i
\end{equation}

The infinitesimal contribution to the total cost by the infinitesimal change in a cost model variable is defined through the total differential of the cost function \ref{eqn:cost_sum} as

\begin{equation}
\text{d}C(x_1 (t), x_2(t), \dots) = \sum_i \frac{\partial C }{\partial x_i}     \frac{\text{d}x_i}{\text{d}t} = \sum_i \frac{\partial C }{\partial x_i}  \Delta x_i
\end{equation}

where $x_i$ is an arbitrary cost variable. The contribution of the change $\Delta x_1$ in variable $x_1$ to total cost $C$ over the period $t_0 < t < t_1 $ is then

\begin{equation}
\Delta C_{x_1} = \int_{t=t_1}^{t_2} \frac{\partial C }{\partial x_1} \frac{\text{d}x_1}{\text{d}t} \text{d}t
\label{eqn:integral_1}
\end{equation}

However, data on the cost model variables is not available in continuous time. Disaggregating the contribution of single variables to the total cost reduction is thus not straightforward in our model. This problem does not arise in cost models which compute cost changes directly, such as \cite{nemet2012solar} \cite{goodrich2013assessing}. The following discussion follows an approach developed by Kavlak et al. \cite{kavlak2018evaluating}. For the detailed derivation, we refer to this publication.

The cost function $C$ as a function of a vector of cost model variables $\vec{r}=(r_1,r_2,\dots)$ is defined as

\begin{equation}
C(\vec{r}) = C(r_1,r_2, \dots) = \sum_i C_i
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
C_i(\vec{r}) = C_i^0 \prod_w g_{iw}(r_w)
\end{equation}

Using logarithmic differentiation, the integral from equation \ref{eqn:integral_1} can be rewritten as

\begin{equation}
\Delta C_x = \int_{t=t_0}^{t_1} C(t) \frac{ \partial \ln C }{ \partial x } \frac{ \text{d} x }{ \text{d} t} \text{d} t
\end{equation}

where for $C(t)$ a constant $C(t) \approx \tilde{C} $ can be chosen such that $\Delta C_{x_i} = \Delta C$. In practice, this constant value can be approximated as $\tilde{C} \approx \frac{2}{3} C_i^\text{geo} + \frac{1}{3} \overline{C_i}$. The contribution of a single cost model variable $r_z$ can then be written as

\begin{equation}
\Delta C_z (t_1,t_2) \approx \sum_i \tilde{C_i} \ln \frac{g_{iz}(t_2)}{g_{iz}(t_1)}
\end{equation}

This approach was used to determine the effect of spillovers on device performance, displayed in figure \ref{fig:breakthroughs_efficiency}. Due to time constraints, this approach could not be used to determine the effect of spillovers on manufacturing cost. Future work to quantify the impact of different cost drivers, including breakthroughs and changes in the manufacturing variables of equation \ref{eqn:cost_sum}, could this method.

\subsection{Examples of Input Data Considered}

\subsubsection{Sapphire Wafers}

Sapphire wafers form the substrate on which all other layers of the light-emitting diode wafer are grown. Being transparent to radiation in the visible spectrum, it is not removed after growth in the Classical architecture or the Thin-Film Flip-Chip architecture. In the Vertical Thin-Film architecture, it is removed by means of a laser-lift-off process. Wafers can be either unpatterned or patterned, where the latter has become commonplace in 2020 due to the beneficial properties that microstructures on the surface have on layer growth \cite{wuu2009defect} and light-extraction efficiency \cite{lee2006enhancing}. The price of sapphire substrates has decreased significantly since the year 2000, as shown in figure \ref{fig:sapphire_prices}. This can be attributed not only to the lighting industry, but more importantly to increased demand from electronics manufacturing \cite{yole2015sapphire}, where sapphire glass is used to protect screens and sensor interfaces from scratches \cite{khattak2016world}. Wafer sizes used in manufacturing have also increased, due to the favourable economics of large wafer processing. The market is dominated by U.S. based \textit{Rubicon Technology} and Russian based \textit{Monocrystal}. The prevalence of wafer diameters used is shown in figure \ref{fig:wafer_size}.

\subsection{Preliminary Sensitivity Analysis}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{2_SSL_EES/article/figures/costmodel_sensitivity.pdf}
	\caption{Sensitivity analysis of selected cost model parameters. Note the decreasing sensitivity to cost model parameters as the number of die per wafer increases. Compare table \ref{tab:sensitivity}. Abbreviations: resp. - respective}
	\label{fig:sensitivity}
\end{figure}

A sensitivity analysis of the cost model has been performed using parameter variations listed in table \ref{tab:sensitivity}. The amount of parameter variation was chosen to encompass the identified range of the value of the parameter in different manufacturing setups of each considered year. As an example, the lower range in the variation for metal cost (+50\%,-0\%) was chosen because the metal prices in the model are price quotes from the United State Geological Survey price database. Industry metals are not sold below the price of the raw material and often the markup is small compared to the price of the material. The upper range was chosen, because a survey of industrial metal suppliers for semiconductor manufacturing showed that the largest markup was below 50\%. The results of the analysis are shown in figure \ref{fig:sensitivity}. The cost model is generally more sensitive to variation of parameters at smaller wafer diameters. The most sensitive parameters are global parameters, such as yield or average equipment throughput.

\subsection{Comparison with Reported Industry Data}

We note differences between our model and costs reported to the US Department of Energy (DoE) by industry. For instance, the share of the epitaxy step is larger in the DoE model. This can in part be explained by our model relying on state-of-the-art equipment, while industry might not run low-power and mid-power chip production on these, more expensive, reactors. The packaging part of the manufacturing process is increasing in importance, which has been confirmed by researchers and industry reports on wafer-level packaging.

	\caption{Modelled manufacturing cost for light-emitting diode packages split by manufacturing step category. The top graph shows the data from LEDCOM model and round table discussions published by the United States Department of Energy (DoE). The bottom graph shows the results of the cost model developed in this thesis. Hatched bars are projections given by the sources. Inset plot shows the number of die per wafer (DPW) calculated for different wafer sizes used in the model.

Sources for Inset Plot: own elaborations based on numerical approximations for die-per-wafer estimations provided in \cite{de2005investigation}, informed by expert interviews.}
	\label{fig:costmodel_calibration}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:costmodel_calibration} shows a comparison of the relative manufacturing cost by manufacturing step categories between the cost model and data released by the United States Department of Energy (DoE). Note that any comparison between the figures must consider: Our model assumes state-of-the-art equipment, while the DoE industry round table reports data from factories which use older equipment, as well as newer equipment. Our model presently considers only low-power and mid-power packages, while the DoE reports consider high-power packages also. Our model assumes a virtual North American manufacturing location, while the majority of manufacturers produce in Asia. We note that the share of the substrate price in the DoE data is much larger than in our model. This can in part be explained by figure \ref{fig:sapphire_prices}, which already shows how projections overestimated the actual price for 2015-2020. We note also that the share of the epitaxy step is larger in the DoE model. This can in part be explained by our model relying on state-of-the-art equipment, while industry might not run low-power and mid-power chip production on these, more expensive, reactors. In conclusion, our model fits industry forecasts due to the way it is set up. The packaging part of the manufacturing process is increasing in importance, which has been confirmed by researchers and industry reports on WLP\cite{Lee2011WPL}\cite{Xie2013}\cite{ledsmag2017WLP}.

\section{Phosphors}

\subsection{History of Identifies Phosphor Inventions}

\subsubsection{YAG and YGAG Phosphors}

Prior to Nakamura’s invention of highly efficient blue LEDs in the 1990s, Japan’s Nichia Corporation had not sold commercially successful semiconductor products, instead specializing in phosphors for cathode ray tubes (CRT) and fluorescent lamps \cite{nakamura2013blue}  . Nevertheless, extensive firm expertise in this area helped Nichia’s Yoshinori Shimizu formulate the principles of using CRT phosphors to convert blue light from Nakamura’s LEDs into white light in 1994 \cite{shimizu1994sheet}\cite{cho2017white}. By 1996, Shimizu and his colleagues developed \cite{bando1996}\cite{shimizu1999light} the first practical LED application of a well-known Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (YAG) CRT phosphor activated with cerium \cite{blasse1967new}, enabling the first commercial white LED products manufactured and sold by Nichia since late 1996 \cite{bando1998development}\cite{cho2017white}. 

Importantly, the YAG phosphor does not exhibit the spectral properties desirable in general illumination applications (see Figure 8 in the main text). An early solution to this problem, which was first discovered in the late 1967 \cite{holloway1969optical} and suggested for LEDs by the same team at Nichia in 1996 \cite{bando1998development}\cite{shimizu1999light}, was to use the gadolinium-doped red-shifted YAG phosphor (YGAG). Used in combination with red-emitting sulfide phosphors, by 2002 it helped bring to the market the first generation of warm white light LED products, e.g., those produced by Lumileds \cite{Mueller2002}. However, sulfide phosphors led to accelerated deterioration of sensitive parts of LED devices and became less efficient as operating temperatures increased. New chemically stable and non-toxic red phosphors were needed. 

\subsubsection{258, SLA and SALON phosphors}

In 1997, Hubert Huppertz and Wolfgang Schnick, working at the University of Bayreuth in Germany, synthesized the first compound in a new class of rare earth nitridosilicate materials \cite{Huppertz1997} later dubbed “258” due to a proportion of elements in its chemical formula. The luminescent properties of these materials were identified by the Schnick’s group, by then at Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, in 2000 \cite{Hppe2000} after a suggestion made to Schnick at a conference following earlier reports of good luminosity properties of europium-doped compounds \cite{Qiua1998}. U.S.-based LED manufacturer Lumileds applied for a patent for the first class of red LED phosphors based on the 258 nitridosilicate chemistry in 2002 \cite{mueller2004phosphor}. The first use of the 258 phosphor in a commercial “Luxeon” LED package was then reported in a joint publication co-authored by inventors from Lumileds and researchers from the Schnick’s group in 2005 \cite{MuellerMach2005}.

Further efforts in LED phosphor development were directed towards synthesizing a red narrow-band phosphor. Narrow LED emission peak widths yield the highest luminous efficacy of radiation, as in this case less light is emitted in the far-red range of the spectrum in which the human eye is not very sensitive. After synthesizing several narrow-band phosphors emitting in yellow \cite{Hppe2004} and cyan \cite{Kechele2009}, the Schnick’s group identified the local cubic cation coordination structure of the cyan phosphor compound as the reason for its narrow band width \cite{lumi2016narrow}. A search for a structurally analogous nitride compound with the narrow red instead of the cyan emission was undertaken. After several unsuccessful attempts, the sought-after cuboidal nitride compound was found in a 2008 publication led by Francis DiSalvo \cite{Park2008Sr}. Based on information provided in this work, Schnick and colleagues synthesized and studied the spectral properties of a new narrow band red SLA phosphor in 2013 \cite{schmidt2013new}\cite{Pust2014}\cite{schmidt2017phosphors}. The material was introduced in commercial LED devices by Lumileds in 2015 \cite{lumi2016narrow_whitepaper}. 

The most recent red narrow-band phosphor breakthrough included in Table 3 and Figure 8 in the main text, indicated as SALON, has been under development during the late 2010s by a group of Austrian and German researchers that included Huppertz, the discoverer of the “258” material, working in collaboration with Osram, another major LED manufacturer \cite{seibald2019phosphor}\cite{Hoerder2019}\cite{Hoerder2020}. The first patent application for this phosphor was filed in 2016. The SALON phosphor is a derivate of the SLA phosphor. Therefore, it is the only innovation related to consumer experience metrics identified in our study that seemingly not involved technology spillovers.

\subsubsection{PFS Phosphor}

Down conversion with ultra-narrow-band phosphor can achieve the highest spectral efficiency. However, few such phosphors have been identified, with even less exhibiting desirable material properties such as thermal stability \cite{Phillips2007}. The first commercially successful ultra-narrow-band red phosphor was developed by General Electric (GE). It is based on a potassium fluorosilicate (PFS) compound activated with manganese ions. Its luminescence was first recorded by Paulusz at GE in 1972 \cite{paulusz1973efficient}. In the early 2000s, while searching for potential new LED phosphor materials for GE’s lighting business at GE Lumination, Emil Radkov rediscovered Paulusz’s findings in the literature. Following extensive research on PFS chemical synthesis and material properties conducted in collaboration with the University of Sofia in Bulgaria, Radkov’s Alma Mater, the PFS phosphor had been under development at GE since 2005 \cite{radkov2006red}\cite{radkov2009red}. This work, supported by public funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Solid-State Lighting program , resulted in a series of critical improvements in the PFS phosphor properties \cite{Setlur2010}\cite{lyons2012color}, eventually enabling its commercialization under the “TriGain” brand in 2015 \cite{trigain_spectrum}\cite{setlur2015trigain}\cite{Murphy2015}.

\subsubsection{Quantum Dots for Light Down-Conversion}

Quantum dots (QD) are semiconductor nanocrystals whose quantum size effects make QDs behave as “artificial atoms”. Semiconductor quantum dots were first synthesized in the Soviet Union in 1981 \cite{ekimov1981quantum} and at Bell Labs in the U.S. in 1983 \cite{Rossetti1983}. Luminescent properties of quantum dots were first empirically observed in 1984 \cite{fojtik1984photo} and extensively studied in the early 1990s. The key feature of QD luminescence discovered in those studies is that its colour is determined by the QD particle size, making it possible to create pure monochromatic blue, green and red light sources just by tuning the QD size. The first application of QDs in LEDs was reported in 1994 in an electroluminescent hybrid QD-polymer LED. However, this LED type could not be used in general illumination due to its very low luminous efficacy. An alternative application of QDs as a kind of a “phosphor” for light down conversion from an LED light source was proposed in the early 2000s as part of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-funded “A Revolution in Lighting“ project at Sandia National Laboratory \cite{simmonsfinal}. This concept was successfully demonstrated by Sandia researchers on a commercial LED in 2003 \cite{shea_rohwer_development_2004}\cite{noauthor_sandia_nodate} and was swiftly taken up and advanced further by a group in Taiwan \cite{chen_white-light_2005}\cite{hsueh-shih_chen_ingan-cdse-znse_2006} The first commercial application of QDs in an LED lamp was brought about by a collaboration between an MIT-born startup QD Vision and the U.S.-based luminaire manufacturer Nexxus Lighting in 2009 \cite{ledprof_nexxusqd}, \cite{bourzac2013quantum}. However, rapid advances in the spectral and conversion performance of down-conversion phosphors and high manufacturing cost of quantum dots resulted in the discontinuation of this product. After finding market success in display backlighting first demonstrated by Samsung in 2010 \cite{Jang2010} and commercialized by QD Vision in Sony television sets in 2013 \cite{bourzac2013quantum}, QDs returned to the general lighting market in products offered by Lumileds \cite{noauthor_global_2017}\cite{noauthor_quantum_2020} around 2017 and Osram in 2019 \cite{osramqdots} in the form of mid-power LED packages that combined QDs with traditional phosphors for light down conversion.
