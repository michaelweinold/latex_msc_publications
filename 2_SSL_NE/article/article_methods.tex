\section{Methods and Data Collection}
\label{sec:methods}

The evolution of LED device architecture and performance as well as the progress in understanding the underlying physical phenomena are well covered in the scholarly literature and patents. However, information provided in such sources is insufficient for our goals on at least three accounts: First, existing work focuses only on selected performance parameters or overall device efficiency, rather than on providing a comprehensive coverage of the whole device sub-efficiencies for a particular LED product or design. Scientific publications also do not always disclose the underlying device architecture or the features responsible for the gains in performance. Second, not all relevant innovations are patented \cite{Pakes_1980,Fontana_2013}. In the case of LED patents in particular, our interviews with industry experts suggest that the propensity to patent is the highest for knowledge related to macroscopic device architecture and chemical composition of phosphors, and the lowest for knowledge related to manufacturing process improvements and microscopic chip architecture that is difficult to reconstruct by reverse engineering. This means that relying only on patent literature would bias results by unduly emphasizing some focus areas and de-emphasizing others. Third, scientific publications and patents typically focus on experimental devices, rather than commercial products. While new LED features, designs and manufacturing methods reported in these sources can potentially result in significant performance gains or cost reductions, it is difficult to ascertain if these improvements have since been adopted in industry.  Furthermore, information on LED manufacturing cost and the effect of process improvements on the total cost is highly proprietary. Estimates are occasionally reported in the scientific literature and company publications, but these often do not disclose which parts of the manufacturing process are responsible for the largest contribution to the overall cost, or which improvements led to cost reductions.

To overcome the limitations of these different methods for understanding technological progress, in this study we rely on a multi-method approach to data collection and analysis, the details of which are provided in Section 2 of the Supplementary Information document. Specifically, we combine information obtained from a systematic review of the primary scientific literature, device datasheets, relevant patents, and industry publications (SI Section 2.1) with information gained from semi-structured interviews with experts from academia and industry (SI Section 2.2), bottom-up manufacturing cost modelling (SI Section 2.3), and our own computations of device sub-efficiencies (SI Section 2.4). We then use this information to track the historical progress in white LED technology over time across the three groups of metrics identified above in the 'Metrics' section and identify its sources in innovation and technology spillovers.
