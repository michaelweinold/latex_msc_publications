\section{Metrics}

Figure 1 in the main publication uses luminous efficacy of radiation as the primary metric to describe progress in lighting technologies. Care must be taken not to confuse this metric with luminous efficacy of source, which is used in \ref{fig:phosphor_spectrum}.

\subsection{Luminous Efficacy of Radiation}
\label{subsec:ler}

This metric describes the match of a light-emitting diode package spectrum to the human visual system. Efficacy in lighting is dependent on the luminosity function, which describes the wavelength-dependent sensitivity of the human eye. A light source emitting very \textit{efficiently} in the infrared yet emitting no visible light has a very low \textit{efficacy}. The luminous efficacy of radiation $K$ is mathematically defined as the normalized, integrated product of the spectral radiant flux of a light source with the wavelength-dependent human sensitivity to light \cite{cie-term-effrad}

\begin{myequation}
\label{eqn:ler}
    K [\text{lm/W}_{opt}]= \frac{\int_0^\infty K( \lambda ) \phi \text{d} \lambda}{\int_0^\infty \phi \text{d} \lambda}
\end{myequation}

where

\begin{align*}
    K &\dots \text{spectral luminous efficacy} \\
    \phi &\dots \text{spectral radiant flux} \\
    \lambda &\dots \text{wavelength}
\end{align*}

This metric can be computed from spectral data alone and does not require additional spectral normalization. It enables straightforward comparison between the performance of different downconversion phosphors, as shown in the top panel of \cref{fig:phosphor_spectrum}. Light sources emitting in the far red or blue part of the spectrum have lower efficacy of radiation. Care must be taken not to confuse this efficacy metric with the \textit{efficacy of source} described in the following subsection.

\subsection{Luminous Efficacy of Source}
\label{subsec:les}

The luminous efficacy \textit{of a light source} $\eta$ is defined as the ratio between the emitted luminous flux and the consumed electrical power \cite{cie-term-effsrc}

\begin{myequation}
    \eta [\text{lm/W}_{el}]= \frac{\phi}{P_{el}}
\end{myequation}

This metric is often cited in device datasheets, scientific literature and textbooks when describing the performance of light-emitting diodes. Care must be taken not to confuse this efficacy metric with the \textit{luminous efficacy of radiation}, which depends only on the spectral characteristics of a light source. As the luminous efficacy of a light source $\eta$ captures the overall device efficacy, it depends on a large number of other device properties and parameters. This makes attribution of changes in this metric to individual changes in device design or manufacturing difficult. For this reason, we do not use this metric in our study.

\subsection{Sub-Efficiencies}

\subsubsection{Forward Voltage Efficiency $\eta_{V_f}$}

Device forward voltage efficiency\footnote{"Joule Efficiency" $\epsilon_J$ in Tsao et al. \cite{tsao2010solid}} (VfE) describes all electrical losses at the interface between the electrodes and the semiconductor and in the bulk. These losses can be due to tunneling and Ohmic resistance at the interface, as well as Ohmic resistance and other electrical losses within the bulk of the semiconductor. It is defined as

\begin{equation}
    \eta_{V_f} = \frac{E_{h\nu}}{V_f}
\end{equation}

where $E_{h\nu}$ denotes the photon energy and $V_f$ is the diode forward voltage \cite{schubert2018light}\cite{tsao2010solid}.

\subsubsection{Light Extraction Efficiency $\eta_{LE}$}

Device light-extraction efficiency (LEE) describes the  losses due to absorption in the material after electron-hole recombination and the associated emission of a photon. It is defined as

\begin{equation}
    \eta_{LE}=\frac{\text{\# of photons out}}{\text{\# of photons created}} = \frac{P_{opt}}{P_{int}}
\end{equation}

where $P_{opt}$ is the optical power of the device and $P_{int}$ is the internal power of the device\cite{schubert2018light}\cite{tsao2010solid}.

\subsubsection{Internal Quantum Efficiency $\eta_{IQ}$}

Internal quantum efficiency (IQE) describes non-radiative recombinatory processes in the semiconductor bulk. It is related to the external quantum efficiency through
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ieq-eqe}
    \eta_{EQ} = \eta_{IQ} \times \eta_{LE}
\end{equation}

and defined as

\begin{equation}
    \eta_{IQ} = \frac{\# \text{of photons created}}{\# \text{of electron-hole pairs in}}
\end{equation}

and depends on the current density of the device\cite{schubert2018light}\cite{tsao2010solid}. 

\subsubsection{Droop $\eta_{droop}$}

Efficiency droop describes the decrease of device internal quantum efficiency at high current densities, which is caused by a number of different physical effects\cite{David2020}. This is often treated separately from internal quantum efficiency in the literature due to its importance in high-power devices. It is defined as

\begin{equation}
    \eta_{droop} = 1 - \frac{\eta_{IQE}}{\eta_{IQE}(A \rightarrow 0)}
\end{equation}

where $\eta_{IQE}(A \rightarrow 0)$ denotes the internal quantum efficiency at low current densities. In practice, droop is often given as the percentage difference between the ideal luminous intensity curve $\phi_{ideal}$ and the real luminous intensity curve $\phi$ at a set diode test current $A_{test}$ as

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:droop}
    D = \frac{\phi_{ideal}(A_{test})-\phi(A_{test})}{\phi_{ideal}(A_{test})/100}
\end{equation}

Therefore, according to this definition, a lack of droop corresponds to a droop efficiency of $\eta_{droop} = 100\%$\cite{schubert2018light}\cite{tsao2010solid}.

\subsubsection{Conversion Efficiency $\eta_{C}$}

Light conversion efficiency (LCE) describes losses in the conversion process of blue light that is the basis for all phosphor-converted white LEDs. These losses are the sum of the Stokes loss and well as scattering/absorption losses. It is defined as

\begin{equation}
    \eta_{C} = \frac{E_{\textcolor{blue}{B}}}{\sum_{i=\textcolor{red}{R},\textcolor{orange}{O},\textcolor{yellow}{Y},\textcolor{teal}{G}} E_i}
\end{equation}

where $E_i$ denotes the total energy of light at the color corresponding to the down-converted photon wavelength \cite{schubert2018light}\cite{tsao2010solid}. Since every individual phosphor component in the device has its own associated conversion losses, the denominator sums over all components, i.e. \textcolor{red}{R}ed, \textcolor{orange}{O}range, \textcolor{yellow}{Y}ellow, \textcolor{teal}{G}reen.

\subsubsection{Spectral Efficiency $\eta_{S}$}

Spectral efficiency (SE) describes losses in the conversion process due to the wavelength-dependent efficiency of the human eyes. Photons converted into the infrared or ultraviolet are lost to illumination purposes. It is defined as

\begin{equation}
    \eta_{S} = \frac{K}{K_{max}(CRI,CCT)}
\end{equation}

where $K$ is the luminous efficacy of radiation of the light source, which can be computed from the device spectrum and the luminosity function, which describes the sensitivity of the human eye. $K_{max}$ is the maximum luminous efficacy of radiation of a perfect light source with the same color rendering performance and correlated color temperature as the light source in question\cite{schubert2018light}\cite{tsao2010solid}.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Manufacturing Cost Model}

\subsubsection{Structure of the Model}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{./figures/cost_model.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic diagram of the cost model showing inputs to each step and computational steps leading to the cost model outputs. For the description of cost variables, see definitions for \cref{eqn:cost_wafer}. For the computation of total cost, see \cref{subsec:cost_computation}. For the computation of changes in total cost, see \cref{sec:contribution_variables}.}
    \label{fig:costmodel-schematic}
\end{figure}

The cost model adapted for this publication is a microeconomic manufacturing cost model. Within the timeframe and scope laid out in the main publication, it returns the total manufacturing cost of phosphor converted warm white light-emitting diode packages. In this computation, it considers the main economic factors associated with operating and maintaining manufacturing equipment. It does not consider costs associated with research and development or those associated with the construction of manufacturing facilities. It considers market trends through their effect on manufacturing parameters.

A schematic diagram of the cost model is presented in \cref{fig:costmodel-schematic}. The cost model is process step-based. It is split between the two stages of the manufacturing process: the first stage combining operations at the wafer level, followed by the LED packaging stage. The model takes as inputs parameters specific to individual manufacturing process steps (\textit{"manufacturing step parameters"}) and parameters affecting all manufacturing steps (\textit{"global parameters"}). The cost for each process step is then computed. The cost model returns returns the costs of individual manufacturing steps as well as the total manufacturing cost. It further considers the yield per step and returns the cumulative yield, the yielded cost per step and the yielded total manufacturing cost.

\subsubsection{Manufacturing Process Steps by Chip Architecture}

\cref{fig:manuf_classical_2003}-\cref{fig:manuf_csp_2020-2} show a simplified rendering of the manufacturing process of three different chip architectures considered in the cost model.

\subsubsection{Computation of Manufacturing Cost}
\label{subsec:cost_computation}

The manufacturing process of semiconductor devices can be categorized by the level at which manufacturing process steps are implemented, i.e., either at the wafer level or at the individual chip/package level. The total manufacturing cost per die is thus the sum of the total costs of all wafer processing steps and all die packaging steps.
\begin{myequation}
\label{eqn:cost_sum}
    C \bigg[ \frac{ \text{USD}(2020) }{ \text{die} } \bigg] = P_S + C_w + C_p
\end{myequation}
where
\begin{align*}
    P_S &\dots \text{sapphire substrate price per die} \\
    C_w &\dots \text{wafer processing cost per die} \\
    C_p &\dots \text{die processing cost}
\end{align*}
The total wafer processing cost and total die packaging costs are in turn the sum of all associated process steps.
\begin{myequation}
        C_w = \sum_i C_i
\end{myequation}
\begin{myequation}
	C_p = \sum_j C_j
\end{myequation}
The cost of a single process step $C_i$ can now be written as
\begin{myequation}
\label{eqn:cost_wafer}
    C_i \bigg[ \frac{ \text{USD}(2020) }{ \text{die} } \bigg] =\frac{1}{DPW}  \frac{1}{y_i}   \bigg\{ \bigg((c_e*p) + c_l + c_m + c_d + c_o \bigg)_i \bigg( \frac{t_i}{w_i u_i} \bigg) + \sum_{x} v_x c_x \bigg\}
\end{myequation}
where the index $i$ runs over all wafer processing steps, the index $j$ runs over all die processing steps and the index $x$ run over all materials.
\begin{align*}
        DPW &\dots \text{number of functional (i.e., successfully tested) die per wafer}\\
        y &\dots \text{process step yield} \\
        u &\dots \text{equipment utilization (relative to theoretical equipment capacity)} \\
        p &\dots \text{power consumption} \\
        c_e &\dots \text{hourly electricity cost} \\
        c_m &\dots \text{hourly maintenance cost} \\
        c_d &\dots \text{hourly depreciation cost}\\
        c_l &\dots \text{hourly labour cost} \\
        c_o &\dots \text{hourly overhead cost} \\
        t_i &\dots \text{time per run} \\
        w &\dots \text{wafers per run} \\
        A &\dots \text{wafer area} \\
        v_x &\dots \text{volume of material $x$ per wafer} \\
        c_x &\dots \text{cost of material $x$ per volume}\\
\end{align*}
The number of die per wafer $D$ depends on the total usable wafer area. The usable area depends on the wafer diameter, the cutting street width between the chips and the exclusion zone at the rim of the wafer.
\begin{myequation}
	A_{\text{usable}}=A_{\text{wafer}}-A_{\text{cut}}-A_{\text{exclusion}}
\end{myequation}
Determining the usable wafer area as a function of these three parameters requires a numerical solution. However, following discussions in the literature \cite{de2005investigation}, we approximate the number of functional die per wafer\footnote{often \textit{"good die per wafer"} in the literature} as
\begin{myequation}
\label{eqn:dpw}
	DPW = \frac{\pi}{4}  \bigg ( \frac{d-2e}{\sqrt{a}+s/2} \bigg ) ^2 - \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{d-2e}{(\sqrt{a}+s/2)^2}
\end{myequation}
where
\begin{align*}
    d &\dots \text{wafer diameter} \\
    e &\dots \text{wafer edge exclusion zone width} \\
    a &\dots \text{die area} \\
    s &\dots \text{cutting street width} \\
\end{align*}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=5.5cm]{./figures/die-per-wafer.pdf}
    \caption{Number of die per wafer for the different wafer sizes used in different years: (DPW) $d(2002)=50$mm$\rightarrow851$DPW, $d(2002)=50$mm$\rightarrow5370$DPW, $d(2020)=100$mm$, \rightarrow26,838$DPW. Source: own estimates, based on \cref{eqn:dpw} and the dominant wafer size of the considered year, informed by expert interviews. For detailed statistics on changes in wafer size, compare also \cref{fig:wafers}.}
    \label{fig:dpw}
\end{figure}

Results are plotted in \cref{fig:dpw}, showing the increase in die per wafer (DPW) over time. \cref{eqn:dpw} then gives us for the cost of a manufacturing step $C_i$ in the wafer processing category
\begin{myequation}
\label{eqn:cost_wafer_full}
\begin{split}
    C_i \bigg[ \frac{ \text{USD}(2020) }{ \text{die} } \bigg] &= \bigg (  \frac{\pi}{4}  \bigg ( \frac{d-2e}{\sqrt{a}+s/2} \bigg ) ^2 - \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{d-2e}{(\sqrt{a}+s/2)^2} \bigg )^{-1} \times \\
    &  \frac{1}{y_i}  \bigg\{ \bigg((c_e*p) + c_l + c_m + c_d + c_o \bigg)_i \bigg( \frac{t_i}{w_i u_i} \bigg) + \sum_{x} v_x c_x \bigg\}
\end{split}
\end{myequation}
and the cost of a manufacturing step $C_j$ in the packaging category
\begin{myequation}
\label{eqn:cost_die}
    C_j \bigg[ \frac{ \text{USD}(2020) }{ \text{die} } \bigg] = \frac{1}{y_j}  \bigg\{ \bigg((c_e*p) + c_l + c_m + c_d + c_o \bigg)_i  \frac{c_j}{u_j} + \sum_{x} a v_x c_x \bigg\}
\end{myequation}
where $c_j$ is $\text{throughput}^{-1}$. The total cost is thus
\begin{myequation}
\label{eqn:cost_total}
\begin{split}
    C= P_s &+ \sum_i \bigg \{ \frac{1}{DPW} \frac{1}{y_i} \bigg[ \frac{t_i}{w_i u_i} \bigg((e*p) + l + m + d +o \bigg)_i  + \sum_{x} v_x p_x \bigg] \bigg \} + \\
    & + \sum_j \bigg \{ \frac{1}{y_j} \bigg[ \frac{c_j}{u_j}  \bigg((e*p) + l + m + d + o \bigg)_i + \sum_{x} a v_x p_x \bigg ] \bigg\}
\end{split}
\end{myequation}
Note that in keeping with the categorization introduced by the United States Department of Energy (cf. eg. \cite{doe_ssl_rnd_2019}), certain steps from these two categories are reported separately. In the wafer processing category, the epitaxy step is reported separately due to its complexity and the large share of cost carried. In the wafer processing category, the phosphor step is reported separately.

\subsubsection{Computation of Yielded Cost}

Devices may be damaged or otherwise rendered unusable during the manufacturing process. The ratio between the number of good devices per step and the number of handled devices per step is known as the yield. Optimizing this yield is critical for reducing manufacturing cost \cite{Kumar2006}. This is because cumulative yield quickly drops as the yield from manufacturing steps with below 100\% yield is multiplied. We must thus consider not only the manufacturing cost per process step, but also the cost including the yield \cite{becker2001use}\cite{becker2001using}. While there are different mathematical approaches to including yield, we follow the definition in \cite{becker2001use}. We write for the yielded cost $C_{Y_i}$ of a step $i$ with associated cost (before considering yield) $C_1$ and yield $Y_1$:

\begin{myequation}
\label{eqn:C_2}
    C_{Y_1} = \frac{C_1}{Y_1}
\end{myequation}
\begin{myequation}
    C_{Y_2} = \frac{C_1 + C_2}{Y_1 Y_2} - C_{Y_1} = \frac{C_1 + C_2}{Y_1 Y_2} - \frac{C_1}{Y_1} = \frac{1}{Y_1 Y_2} \bigg ( C_1 (1-Y_2) +C_2 \bigg)
\end{myequation}
\begin{myequation}
    C_{Y_i} = \frac{ \sum_{x \leq i} C_x }{ \prod_{x \leq i} Y_x } - \frac{ \sum_{x<i} C_x }{ \prod_{x<i} Y_x }
\end{myequation}

If a step is applied more than once, we can conveniently rewrite this in a form suited to computation within the \textit{Excel} worksheet. Assuming step $2$ is used twice, we get for the yielded cost of this step an equation of the form

\begin{myequation}
\label{eqn:C_2^2}
    C_{Y_2}^{(2 \times)} = \bigg( \frac{C_1 + C_2}{Y_1 Y_2} - \frac{C_1}{Y_1} \bigg) + \bigg( \frac{C_1 + 2 C_2}{Y_1 Y_2^2} - \frac{C_1 + C_2}{Y_1 Y_2}     \bigg)
\end{myequation}
\begin{myequation}
    = \frac{1}{Y_1 Y_2^2} \bigg( C_1 (1-Y_2^2) +2C_2 \bigg)
\end{myequation}

which can be compared to  \cref{eqn:C_2} to find a more general form:

\begin{myequation}
    C_{Y_2}^{(n \times)} = \frac{1}{Y_1 Y_2^n} \bigg( C_1 (1-Y_2^n)+nC_2\bigg)
\end{myequation}

It can be shown by induction that the general form of a term for a step $i>1$ repeated $n$ times can be expressed as:

\begin{myequation}
\label{eqn:yielded_cost}
    C_{Y_{i>1}}^{(n \times)} = \frac{1}{Y_i^{n-1} \prod_{x \leq i} Y_x} \bigg( nC_i + \sum_{x < i} C_x (1-Y_i^n) \bigg)
\end{myequation}

This cumulative approach to yielded cost is different from the approach taken in the original \textit{LEDCOM} model. It uses what in the literature is described as an \textit{"itemized approach"} to yielded cost \cite{becker2001use}. In this approach, the yielded cost of a single process step $f$ is described as

\begin{myequation}
    f_\text{single} = \frac{i+s}{y}
\end{myequation}

where

\begin{align*}
    i &\dots \text{material cost of previous step} \\
    s &\dots \text{step cost}
\end{align*}

For process steps that are performed more than once, a series expression is used

\begin{myequation}
    f_{\times 2} =  \frac{\frac{i+s}{y}+s}{y}
\end{myequation}
\begin{myequation}
\label{eqn:series}
    f_{\times n} = \frac{i + s(1+y+y^2+ \dots + y^{n-1})}{y^n}
\end{myequation}

This itemized approach serves as a convenient approximation, but its cumulative contributions do not equal the total yielded cost of the entire manufacturing process

\begin{myequation}
    f_\text{total} = \frac{\sum_i^n s_i}{\prod_i^ny_i} \neq \sum_i^n f_i
\end{myequation}

where $n$ is the total number of steps. This is due to the approximation introduced through the series approximation in  \cref{eqn:series}.

\subsubsection{Example of Input Data Considered: Sapphire Wafers}

Sapphire wafers form the substrate on which all other layers of the light-emitting diode are grown. Being transparent to radiation in the visible spectrum, it is not removed after growth in the Classical architecture or the Thin-Film Flip-Chip architecture. In the Vertical Thin-Film architecture, it is removed by means of a laser-lift-off process. Wafers can be either unpatterned or patterned, where the latter has become commonplace by 2020 due to the beneficial properties that microstructures on the surface have on layer growth \cite{wuu2009defect} and light-extraction efficiency \cite{lee2006enhancing}. The price of sapphire substrates has decreased significantly since the year 2000, as shown in the bottom panel of \cref{fig:wafers}. This can be attributed not only to the lighting industry, but more importantly to increased supply as a result of increased demand from electronics manufacturing \cite{yole2015sapphire}, where sapphire glass is used to protect screens and sensor interfaces from scratches \cite{khattak2016world}. Wafer sizes used in manufacturing have also increased, due to the favourable economics of large wafer processing. The market has been dominated by U.S.-based \textit{Rubicon Technology} and Russian-based \textit{Monocrystal}. he evolution of sapphire wafer prices and diameters used in LED manufacturing over the years is shown in top panel of \cref{fig:wafers}.

\subsubsection{Preliminary Sensitivity Analysis}

\begin{figure}[]
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{2_SSL_EST/article/figures/costmodel_sensitivity.pdf}
	\caption{Sensitivity analysis for selected cost model parameters. Panel a represents the tested range of variation of parameters indicated on horizontal axis along with their respective measurement units, as represented in \cref{tab:sensitivity}. Panel b shows the resulting range of variation in the manufacturing cost. Ranges are represented for three years considered in the cost model, where corresponding data is available, by whiskers of the following colour: 2003 – blue, 2012 – green, 2020 – red. Note the overall trend of decreasing sensitivity to cost model parameters as the number of die per wafer increases over time. Abbreviations: resp. - respective; yield sav. from insp. - yield savings from inspection.}
	\label{fig:sensitivity}
\end{figure}

A sensitivity analysis of the cost model has been performed using parameter variations listed in table \cref{tab:sensitivity}. The amount of parameter variation was chosen to encompass the identified range of parameter values in different manufacturing setups for each considered year. As an example, the lower range in the variation for the price of metals used in the model (+50\%,-0\%) was chosen because the prices quotes from the United State Geological Survey price database. Industry metals are not sold below the price of the raw material and often the markup is small compared to the price of the material. The upper range was chosen because a survey of industrial metal suppliers for semiconductor manufacturing showed that the largest markup was below 50\%. The results of the analysis are shown in  \cref{fig:sensitivity}. The cost model is generally more sensitive to the variation in parameters at smaller wafer diameters. The most sensitive parameters are global parameters, such as yield or average equipment throughput.

\subsubsection{Comparison with Reported Industry Data and DOE Projections}

We conducted a comparison of the LED manufacturing cost structure produced by our cost model with previously reported US DOE calculations and projections based on the LEDCOM model and industry data provided as part of industry round table discussions (see \cref{fig:costmodel_calibration}). We note some differences between the results of our model and the cost structure reported or projected by the DOE. For instance, the share of the epitaxy step is consistently larger in the DOE data. This can in part be explained by our model relying on state-of-the-art equipment at a virtual US-based manufacturing location, while industry might not run low-power and mid-power chip production on these, more expensive, reactors. In addition, the manufacturing lines of the majority of manufacturers is located in Asia. We also note that the share of the substrate price in the DOE data is much larger than in our model, which can in part be explained by the overestimation of the actual price of sapphire wafers in earlier projections for 2015-2020. Finally, the relative importance of the packaging part of the manufacturing process is very similar in our model and in the DOE results in 2012. However, in the DOE projections it significantly decreases by 2020, while in our model it retains and even increases its share of the total cost. This trend has been independently confirmed by researchers and industry reports on wafer-level packaging \cite{Lee2011WPL}\cite{Xie2013}\cite{ledsmag2017WLP}, showing better performance of our cost model compared to earlier DOE model projections

\subsection{Computation of Contribution of Individual Variables}
\label{sec:contribution_variables}

To quantify the drivers of changes in manufacturing cost or device performance among many contributing factors, one would need to identify the magnitude of contribution to these changes made by single variables in equations \cref{eqn:cost_wafer} and \cref{eqn:cost_die}. Mathematically, given a function $C$ which describes the manufacturing cost or performance function of a device at time $t$,
\begin{myequation}
F=ab+cd
\end{myequation}
and input variables $a,b,c,d$, we are looking for the contribution $\Delta F_{a}$ made by a single variable $a$ to the total change in the function value $\Delta F$ between points $t_0,t_1$ such, that
\begin{myequation}
\Delta F = F(t_1)-C(t_0) = \sum_{i=a, \dots, d} \Delta F_i
\end{myequation}
The infinitesimal contribution to the total funcation value by the infinitesimal change in an input variable is defined through the total differential of the function as
\begin{myequation}
\text{d}F(x_1 (t), x_2(t), \dots) = \sum_i \frac{\partial F }{\partial x_i}     \frac{\text{d}x_i}{\text{d}t} = \sum_i \frac{\partial F }{\partial x_i}  \Delta x_i
\end{myequation}
where $x_i$ is an input cost variable. The contribution of the change $\Delta x_1$ in variable $x_1$ to the total function value $F$ over the period $t_0 < t < t_1 $ is then
\begin{myequation}
\Delta F_{x_1} = \int_{t=t_1}^{t_2} \frac{\partial F }{\partial x_1} \frac{\text{d}x_1}{\text{d}t} \text{d}t
\label{eqn:integral_1}
\end{myequation}
However, data on the input variables is not available in continuous time. Disaggregating the contribution of single variables to the change in the cost or performance is thus not straightforward in our model. This problem does not arise in cost models which compute cost changes directly, such as \cite{nemet2012solar} \cite{goodrich2013assessing}. In our work, we propose to address this problem by following an approach developed by Kavlak et al. \cite{kavlak2018evaluating}. For the detailed derivation, we refer to this publication.

The function $F$ as a function of a vector of input model variables $\vec{r}=(r_1,r_2,\dots)$ is defined as
\begin{myequation}
    F(\vec{r}) = F(r_1,r_2, \dots) = \sum_i F_i
\end{myequation}
where
\begin{myequation}
    F_i(\vec{r}) = F_i^0 \prod_w g_{iw}(r_w)
\end{myequation}
Using logarithmic differentiation, the integral from  \cref{eqn:integral_1} can be rewritten as
\begin{myequation}
    \Delta F_x = \int_{t=t_0}^{t_1} F(t) \frac{ \partial \ln F }{ \partial x } \frac{ \text{d} x }{ \text{d} t} \text{d} t
\end{myequation}
where for $F(t)$ a constant $F(t) \approx \tilde{F} $ can be chosen such that $\Delta F_{x_i} = \Delta F$. In practice, this constant value can be approximated through the geometric and arithmetic means $\tilde{F} \approx \frac{2}{3} F_i^\text{geo} + \frac{1}{3} \overline{F_i}$. The contribution of a single cost model variable $r_z$ can then be written as
\begin{myequation}
    \Delta F_z (t_1,t_2) \approx \sum_i \tilde{F_i} \ln \frac{g_{iz}(t_2)}{g_{iz}(t_1)}
\end{myequation}
We use this approach to estimate the effect of individual innovations and spillovers on LED device performance, as discussed in section 4.3 and shown in Figure 5 in the main article. Due to time constraints, we leave the quantification of the impact of different drivers of cost reductions with this methodological approach for our future work.

\subsection{Phosphor-Related}
\label{sec:innovation_phosphor}

This section provides additional details for phosphor-related LED innovations identified in this study as affecting both spectral sub-efficiencies and consumer experience metrics and discussed in section 5.2, Table 1 and Figures 5-7 in the main article.

\subsubsection{History of Identified Phosphor-Related LED Innovations}

\paragraph{YAG and YGAG Phosphors}

Prior to Nakamura’s invention of highly efficient blue LEDs in the 1990s, Japan’s Nichia Corporation had not sold commercially successful semiconductor products, instead specializing in phosphors for cathode ray tubes (CRT) and fluorescent lamps \cite{nakamura2013blue}  . Nevertheless, extensive firm expertise in this area helped Nichia’s Yoshinori Shimizu formulate the principles of using CRT phosphors to convert blue light from Nakamura’s LEDs into white light in 1994 \cite{shimizu1994sheet}\cite{cho2017white}. By 1996, Shimizu and his colleagues developed \cite{bando1996}\cite{shimizu1999light} the first practical LED application of a well-known Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (YAG) CRT phosphor activated with cerium \cite{blasse1967new}, enabling the first commercial white LED products manufactured and sold by Nichia since late 1996 \cite{bando1998development}\cite{cho2017white}. 

Importantly, the YAG phosphor does not exhibit the spectral properties desirable in general illumination applications (see Figure 7 in the main article). An early solution to this problem, which was first discovered in the late 1967 \cite{holloway1969optical} and suggested for LEDs by the same team at Nichia in 1996 \cite{bando1998development}\cite{shimizu1999light}, was to use the gadolinium-doped red-shifted YAG phosphor (YGAG). Used in combination with red-emitting sulfide phosphors, by 2002 it helped bring to the market the first generation of warm white light LED products, e.g., those produced by Lumileds \cite{Mueller2002}. However, sulfide phosphors led to accelerated deterioration of sensitive parts of LED devices and became less efficient as operating temperatures increased. New chemically stable and non-toxic red phosphors were needed. 

\paragraph{258, SLA and SALON phosphors}

In 1997, Hubert Huppertz and Wolfgang Schnick, working at the University of Bayreuth in Germany, synthesized the first compound in a new class of rare earth nitridosilicate materials \cite{Huppertz1997} later dubbed “258” due to a proportion of elements in its chemical formula. The luminescent properties of these materials were identified by the Schnick’s group, by then at Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, in 2000 \cite{Hppe2000} after a suggestion made to Schnick at a conference following earlier reports of good luminosity properties of europium-doped compounds \cite{Qiua1998}. U.S.-based LED manufacturer Lumileds applied for a patent for the first class of red LED phosphors based on the 258 nitridosilicate chemistry in 2002 \cite{mueller2004phosphor}. The first use of the 258 phosphor in a commercial “Luxeon” LED package was then reported in a joint publication co-authored by inventors from Lumileds and researchers from the Schnick’s group in 2005 \cite{MuellerMach2005}.

Further efforts in LED phosphor development were directed towards synthesizing a red narrow-band phosphor. Narrow LED emission peak widths yield the highest luminous efficacy of radiation, as in this case less light is emitted in the far-red range of the spectrum in which the human eye is not very sensitive. After synthesizing several narrow-band phosphors emitting in yellow \cite{Hppe2004} and cyan \cite{Kechele2009}, the Schnick’s group identified the local cubic cation coordination structure of the cyan phosphor compound as the reason for its narrow band width \cite{lumi2016narrow}. A search for a structurally analogous nitride compound with the narrow red instead of the cyan emission was undertaken. After several unsuccessful attempts, the sought-after cuboidal nitride compound was found in a 2008 publication led by Francis DiSalvo \cite{Park2008Sr}. Based on information provided in this work, Schnick and colleagues synthesized and studied the spectral properties of a new narrow band red SLA phosphor in 2013 \cite{schmidt2013new}\cite{Pust2014}\cite{schmidt2017phosphors}. The material was introduced in commercial LED devices by Lumileds in 2015 \cite{lumi2016narrow_whitepaper}. 

The most recent red narrow-band phosphor innovation included in Table 1 and Figure 7 in the main article, indicated as SALON, has been under development during the late 2010s by a group of Austrian and German researchers that included Huppertz, the discoverer of the “258” material, working in collaboration with Osram, another major LED manufacturer \cite{seibald2019phosphor}\cite{Hoerder2019}\cite{Hoerder2020}. The first U.S. patent application for this phosphor was filed in 2017 \cite{seibald2019phosphor}. The SALON phosphor is a derivate of the SLA phosphor. Therefore, it is the only innovation related to consumer experience metrics identified in our study that seemingly not involved technology spillovers.

\paragraph{PFS Phosphor}

Down conversion with ultra-narrow-band phosphor can achieve the highest spectral efficiency. However, few such phosphors have been identified, with even less exhibiting desirable material properties such as thermal stability \cite{Phillips2007}. The first commercially successful ultra-narrow-band red phosphor was developed by General Electric (GE). It is based on a potassium fluorosilicate (PFS) compound activated with manganese ions. Its luminescence was first recorded by Adrian Paulusz at GE in 1972 \cite{paulusz1973efficient}. In the early 2000s, while searching for potential new LED phosphor materials for GE’s lighting business at GE Lumination, Emil Radkov rediscovered Paulusz’s findings in the literature. Following extensive research on PFS chemical synthesis and material properties conducted in collaboration with the University of Sofia in Bulgaria, Radkov’s Alma Mater, the PFS phosphor had been under development at GE since 2005 \cite{radkov2006red}\cite{radkov2009red}. This work, supported by public funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Solid-State Lighting program \cite{doesslprogram}, resulted in a series of critical improvements in the PFS phosphor properties \cite{Setlur2010}\cite{lyons2012color}, eventually enabling its commercialization under the “TriGain” brand in 2015 \cite{trigain_spectrum}\cite{setlur2015trigain}\cite{Murphy2015}.

\paragraph{Quantum Dots for Light Down-Conversion}

Quantum dots (QD) are semiconductor nanocrystals whose quantum size effects make QDs behave as “artificial atoms”. Semiconductor quantum dots were first synthesized in the Soviet Union in 1981 \cite{ekimov1981quantum} and at Bell Labs in the U.S. in 1983 \cite{Rossetti1983}. Luminescent properties of quantum dots were first empirically observed in 1984 \cite{fojtik1984photo} and extensively studied in the early 1990s. The key feature of QD luminescence discovered in those studies is that its colour is determined by the QD particle size, making it possible to create pure monochromatic blue, green and red light sources just by tuning the QD size. The first application of QDs in LEDs was reported in 1994 in an electroluminescent hybrid QD-polymer LED. However, this LED type could not be used in general illumination due to its very low luminous efficacy. An alternative application of QDs as a kind of a “phosphor” for light down conversion from an LED light source was proposed in the early 2000s as part of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-funded “A Revolution in Lighting“ project at Sandia National Laboratory \cite{simmonsfinal}. This concept was successfully demonstrated by Sandia researchers on a commercial LED in 2003 \cite{shea_rohwer_development_2004}\cite{noauthor_sandia_nodate} and was swiftly taken up and advanced further by a group in Taiwan \cite{Chen_2005}\cite{Hsueh_Shih_Chen_2006} The first commercial application of QDs in an LED lamp was brought about by a collaboration between an MIT-born startup QD Vision and the U.S.-based luminaire manufacturer Nexxus Lighting in 2009 \cite{ledprof_nexxusqd}, \cite{bourzac2013quantum}. However, rapid advances in the spectral and conversion performance of down-conversion phosphors and high manufacturing cost of quantum dots resulted in the discontinuation of this product. After finding market success in display backlighting first demonstrated by Samsung in 2010 \cite{Jang2010} and commercialized by QD Vision in Sony television sets in 2013 \cite{bourzac2013quantum}, QDs returned to the general lighting market in products offered by Lumileds \cite{noauthor_global_2017}\cite{noauthor_quantum_2020} around 2017 and Osram in 2019 \cite{osramqdots} in the form of mid-power LED packages that combined QDs with traditional phosphors for light down conversion.

Top panel: Luminous efficacy of radiation (LER) and colour rendering index (CRI) of white LED devices represented in Figure 7 in the main article. The desirable direction of improvements towards higher luminous efficacy at higher CRI is indicated by a red arrow.

The luminosity function \cite{cie-term-lumeff}, describing the wavelength-dependent sensitivity of the human eye, is shown for reference in red in each panel. Note that peaks or large tails of the device emission spectrum at the far ends of the luminosity function are not desirable, as the photons of the corresponding energy are lost to the human eye and count towards the spectral loss channel.

\subsection{Historical Progress in Sub-Efficiencies}

The historical progress in the different sub-efficiencies contributing to overall efficiency (lamp efficiency) is shown in \cref{fgr:subeff}. Context for figure panels is provided below:

\textbf{Panel A1:} Device forward voltage at a test current of I=350mA. The physical limit for a blue light wavelength of 450nm without electric pumping is shown for reference. Data points for devices released in 2020 by various manufacturers are shown in an inset plot. \

\textbf{Panel A2:} Efficiency droop at the test current of I=350mA. \

\textbf{Panel B1:} Internal quantum efficiency, for different chip architectures, by type of measurement used. Note that the artifact in the DOE Average around 2013 is due to a change in definition for internal quantum efficiency laid out in \cite{doe_ssl_multiyear_2013}. Measurement methods: PL - Photoluminescence\cite{Shim_2018}, EL - Electroluminescence\cite{Getty_2009};  ABC Model\cite{Karpov_2014}, Ideality Factor\cite{Masui_2010}. “Not reported” denotes data points where the IQE measurement technique was not reported. Whiskers indicate reported ranges, where applicable. \

\textbf{Panel B2:} Light extraction efficiency for different chip architectures, by type of specific technology used to improve light-extraction efficiency. The source of data points is shown for reference: simulation - ray-tracing computer simulation; experimental (absolute) - light-extraction efficiency given directly; experimenal (relative) - relative improvement over baseline chip architecture given.

\section{Previous Literature}
\label{sec:prev_lit}

The historical development development of light-emitting diodes from a novelty semiconductor experiment into powerful lighting devices has received a considerable amount of attention following the recognition of pioneering work on blue LED by Japanese researchers Shuji Nakamura, Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano with the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics \cite{Akasaki2015}\cite{Nakamura2015}. The sources and disaggregated contributions of subsequent improvements in LED technology, however, have not been documented in the literature in a systematic fashion, though there were notable publications reporting on the progress in the design of devices \cite{Shchekin2006}\cite{krames2007led}\cite{laubsch2009high}\cite{hahn2014development}, or the technological improvements  underlying the improvement in overall device efficiency for best performers in 2009 \cite{tsao2010solid} and 2016 \cite{pattison2017solid}. 

Several descriptive publications provide a very useful overview of selected scientific breakthroughs that have contributed to LED progress \cite{krames2007status}\cite{Phillips2007}\cite{Bierhuizen2007}\cite{Nakamura2013}\cite{feezell2018invention}\cite{Taki2019}. Additional studies provide more detail regarding the origin and impact of specific advances in LED technology as well as their integration into device manufacturing were published by authors working for key industry actors Lumileds\cite{MuellerMach2005}\cite{Shchekin2006}\cite{lumi2015lumi}\cite{Bhardwaj2017} and Osram (now amsOsram)\cite{Haerle2004}\cite{Baur2009}\cite{laubsch2009high}\cite{hahn2014development}. However, these studies typically include limited information on the macro-level chip design and cover disparate aspects of the technology over different time periods. Another important source of historical information are patents, which cover the entirety of the device architecture or manufacturing process, including those by Lumileds\cite{margalith2011thin}, Samsung\cite{jung2014phos}\cite{cha2019semiconductor} and Soraa\cite{cich2017high}.

We summarize the information collected, analysed and classified on the progress in LED chip architectures and manufacturing processes from these and other disparate sources in Figure \ref{fgr:chip_architecture_overview}, where we show the evolution of LEDs from classical chips with lateral current spreading to chip-scale package flip-chip architectures. Despite the amount of literature published on the topic of LED history, we are not aware of a prior publication that comprehensively and consistently aggregates and analyzes known chip design, manufacturing, and material improvements to show the overall effect of these improvements on device efficiency or manufacturing cost over time. In addition, the effect of individual innovations and technology spillovers, which has been investigated in solar PV \cite{kavlak2018evaluating}\cite{kolesnikov2020novel}\cite{nemet2019solar}, and to some extent in lithium-ion batteries \cite{Stephan2021}, has not yet been studied in the context of lighting. This is consistent with previous observations regarding the marginalization of end-use technologies in the analysis of energy innovation for climate change impact mitigation \cite{Wilson2012}\cite{Creutzig2018}.
